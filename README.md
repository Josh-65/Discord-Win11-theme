## Functionality changes
Some controls have moved to conform with Windows 11 styles.


### Moved settings
- Toast/Notifications now have an global toggle in the themes settings
<!-- - Mute and deafen settings are now shown only on the voice connected panel-->
- Settings is now a toggle on the same icon in the server bar
- Stickers and GIFs are now all in the emote menu
- Search bars are on the title bar
- User profile is now in the title bar next to window controls


### Other
- User/Members list will now auto hide at smallest window size. (Toggle doesn't do anything visibly at min size but will save state upon resize)
- Due to layering issues the Window drag area is small bar at top of the window
